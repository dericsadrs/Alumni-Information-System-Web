# Alumni Information System

Alumni Information System is an interactive generic web application and a mobile application designed for the faculty and alumni of any kind of university. The application aims to keep track and maintain the school’s record of alumni information and create opportunities for alumni and their institution to stay connected and engage with their college mates and friends.

The application has two main modules: a University Management System and an Alumni Management System.

## Application Evaluation

An evaluation was conducted to measure the overall experience of the users while interacting with the system and to measure the usability of the application. The purpose of this is to understand how users interact with the system and identify areas where improvements can be made to enhance the overall user experience. The evaluation assesses different aspects of the user experience, such as satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived usefulness of the system.

# Alumni Information System

## Project Context
The graduate stays in touch with their immediate friends but finds it difficult to stay connected with their fellow college mates and their institution. They have no idea where to contact their fellow alumni. With this problem, the researchers were able to come up with the idea of developing a generic information system for the alumni of the university. Developing a web and mobile application for keeping track of the alumni record will provide a communication tool and a platform for announcements, opportunities, questions, answers, and information that may be helpful to the alumni and the institution itself.

The web and mobile applications will provide opportunities that will be beneficial to both the university and the alumni. This also aids the university when it comes to manual tedious tasks, By having an application that has multiple features for updating, maintaining, storing, and communicating allowing both parties to engage with their alumni through announcements, events, and the question and answer forum tab. Providing a platform where they can ask questions, seek job opportunities, and connect with their fellow alumni enables them to build a solid professional network and helps them to connect and reach out to their fellow alumni and alma mater.

The system has different users for each application. For the web, we have two users (Alumni and College Admin). The alumni can interact with the system; they can view announcements and delete and edit their own posts, questions, announcements, and opportunities. They can also answer questions posted by their fellow alumni and apply for an ID. The College Administrators can manage the records of alumni. The Administrator can delete any post, edit any post, post and approve postings, edit university profile, approve a user’s registration, edit the configuration, verify the alumni identity, and maintain the integrity of the web portal.

For the Mobile application, we only have one user which is the alumni. The alumni can view and post announcements, questions, and answers. The alumni can also view the about page, search for alumni, and view the gallery.

## Purpose and Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a web and mobile application to help the university when it comes to establishing communication between the alumni and their alma mater. The system will aid all the colleges and departments in a university to find people for the right event, communicate, share experiences, post announcements, look for recommendations, and seek opportunities. The system will provide a platform to share information, provide help, and create opportunities while maintaining connections with fellow alumni and their institutions. The system will help the alumni and the university maintain connectivity and keep track and enhance their database system that holds all the information of their alumni.

By providing a system that enables the university to track and establish a connection with its alumni, the university will have more access when it comes to opportunities, employment, information, and charity. The same thing goes for the alumni; it will allow them to be updated when it comes to job opportunities, events, and reunions among their peers.

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to develop a fully functional interactive web-based and mobile application Alumni Information System for any university. To achieve the general objective, the following specific objectives must be accomplished:

### Specific Objectives
- Conduct data gathering to universities to understand the data needed to be gathered from the alumni and processes of Alumni Offices that can be automated and implemented in the application.
- Design and develop a web application that has a University management system and Alumni management system with the following features:
  - University Management system (Administrator):
    - This module allows an administrator to create and archive an instance of their university.
    - This module allows an admin to set up university profile.
    - Edit University profile.
    - Upload University logo.
    - Approve alumni post, gallery upload, alumni registration, ID application.
    - Query, Sort, and create a "pdf" file of alumni in alumni list table.
    - Post job opportunities, announcements, gallery uploads, perks, advertisements, post courses, post questions, answers, and view an ID Application.
    - Search specific alumnus
    - Receive ID Application, view job opportunities, announcements, gallery uploads, perks, advertisements, post questions, and answer questions, and view ID Application.
    - Edit and Delete job opportunities, announcements, gallery uploads, perks, advertisements, post questions, and answer questions.
  - Alumni Management System:
    - This module allows alumni to register an account in the system.
    - This module allows alumni to post and apply for a job opportunity.
    - Allows to post announcements in the feed and upload images. (If permitted)
    - Allows alumni to delete their own posts and edit their own post (if approved by the admin)
    - Allows an alumnus to update and edit their own profile.
    - Allows alumni to search for specific alumnus.
    - Allow alumni to post job opportunities and question and answer.
    - Allow alumni to edit and delete their own posts of job opportunities, questions, and answers.
    - Allow alumni to view announcements, job opportunities, gallery images, advertisements, perks, questions and answers, and about pages.
    - Notified for approval and ID application.
    - Apply for an ID Application.
- Design and develop a mobile application for Alumni user accounts that has the following features:
  - Login Module - This module allows users to log in to the application.
  - Job Posting Module - This module allows alumni to view and post job postings.
  - Feed Posting Module - This module allows alumni to view and post announcements/events.
  - Search - This module lets alumni search for different alumni members and view their basic information.
  - About Module - In this module, it discusses the information about the system.
  - Question and Answer module - This module allows alumni to view and post discussions.
  - Gallery Module - This module allows alumni to view collections of pictures and upload images during the university's outreach, events, fiesta, meetups, reunions, etc.
  - Perks module - This module allows alumni to view perks, discounts, vouchers, promos, and benefits of being a member of the alumni.

## Scope and Limitations
In this project, we are aiming to develop a generic alumni information system. This system will be developed in both mobile and web applications, using Laravel (PHP and MySQL) for the web and Flutter and Dart for the mobile application. This study focuses on helping the alumni to get connected and have some interaction with their fellow alumni. Developing the system will benefit not only the universities but also their alumni graduates. The study is only limited to the Universities in the Philippines. Only alumni (Graduates) can use this application.
