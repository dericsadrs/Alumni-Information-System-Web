# Alumni Information System

Alumni Information System is an interactive generic web application and a mobile application designed for the faculty and alumni of any kind of university. The application aims to keep track and maintain the school’s record of alumni information and create opportunities for alumni and their institution to stay connected and engage with their college mates and friends.

The application has two main modules: a University Management System and an Alumni Management System.

## Application Evaluation

An evaluation was conducted to measure the overall experience of the users while interacting with the system and to measure the usability of the application. The purpose of this is to understand how users interact with the system and identify areas where improvements can be made to enhance the overall user experience. The evaluation assesses different aspects of the user experience, such as satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived usefulness of the system.
